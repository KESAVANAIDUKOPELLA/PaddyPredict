# 🌾 Rice Grain Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on classifying different types of rice grains using structured/tabular data and machine learning models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM.

## 📌 Project Overview

Rice grain classification plays a crucial role in quality control, sorting, and agricultural automation. This project applies supervised learning techniques to predict rice grain types based on measurable features.

### 🔍 Objective

To build an accurate and efficient classification model that identifies the type of rice grain based on its physical characteristics from a given dataset.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used contains various measurements of rice grains such as:
- Area
- Perimeter
- Kernel length
- Kernel width
- Compactness
- ...and more

Each row represents one rice grain sample, labeled with its corresponding variety (e.g., **Jasmine**, **Basmati**, etc.).

> **Note:** Dataset is included in the repository as `rice_data.csv` (or replace with actual filename).
