🌾 Rice Type Classification - Tabular Classification using PyTorch
This project demonstrates a deep learning approach to classify different types of rice grains using tabular data. The model is built with PyTorch and trained on the Rice Type Classification Dataset from Kaggle.

📌 Project Objective
To classify rice grains into their respective categories based on various numerical features like area, perimeter, and compactness using a neural network.
